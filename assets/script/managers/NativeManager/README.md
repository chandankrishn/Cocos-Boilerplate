# Native Call Manager Boilerplate

The Native Call Manager is a boilerplate class that provides a unified interface for making native function calls on both iOS and Android platforms within a Cocos Creator project.

## Usage

1. Import the `NativeCallManager` class into your TypeScript project.

```typescript
import { NativeCallManager } from './NativeCallManager';
Call native functions using the callNativeFunction method.
typescript
Copy code
NativeCallManager.Instance.callNativeFunction();
Ensure that you have the necessary libraries and modules imported:
typescript

import { _decorator, Component, native, Node, sys } from "cc";
const { ccclass, property } = _decorator;
The callNativeFunction method determines the operating system and calls the appropriate native function:
On iOS, it calls the native function "downLoadZip:andContent:" in the "AppDelegate" class.
On Android, it calls the native function "ZipDownload" in the "com/cocos/game/AppActivity" class.
Make sure to replace the placeholder function names and class names with the actual ones used in your native code.

API
